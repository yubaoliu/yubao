# Overview

I start building my own blog useing Jekyll. And I find many disadvantages. The most important is that it cannot be used to write accademic document.
I do some try:
- replace **kramdown** with **pandoc** using [mfenner/jekyll-pandoc
](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-pandoc). It can work locally, however, failed in Github pages.
- Cross reference and numbering for Figure and Tables

# Future work

Convert posts to html locally, and then push to GitHub. This means, I need to build my blog manually rather than Jekyll.

I will still use pandoc syntax to write post.

# Task list
- [ ] Learn Web Development Knowledgep
- [ ] Build my Pandoc blog in https://github.com/yubaoliu/blog
- [ ] Upload pictures and videos to remote cloud
