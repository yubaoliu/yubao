# Prepare

## __Important Notes__

- make sure **anaconda** is not installed, it may cause uncertain errors later. I encountered many unkown problems when compile SLAM and kinetic. And not use anaconda to install Python. Then install anaconda after everything works fun (not add anaconda to \$PATH is renewcommand).

- Select  proper Linux Version

According to [ROS Kinetic installation instructions](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation),

>  ROS Kinetic installation instructions
>
> These instructions will install the **ROS Kinetic Kame** distribution, which is available for Ubuntu Wily (15.10) and Ubuntu Xenial (16.04 LTS), among other platform options.
