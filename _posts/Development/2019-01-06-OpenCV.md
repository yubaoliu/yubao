# Overview

[opencv_org](https://opencv.org/)
[OpenCV-Python Tutorials](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html)

**Note**:
<u>Before compile OpenCV from source code, remove _/anaconda2/bin_  from PATH under the current terminal</u>

**Config with ccmake or CMake-GUI**:

select:

  - BUILD_ZLIB
  - opencv_world

# Installing OpenCV-Python from Pre-built Binaries

Install package [python-opencv](https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/python-opencv) with following command in terminal (as root user).

```$ sudo apt-get install python-opencv```

if you are on linux you can do :

```sh
pip install opencv-python
```

or

```sh
conda install opencv
```

Open Python IDLE (or IPython) and type following codes in Python terminal.

```python
>>> import cv2
>>> print cv2.__version__
3.4.3
```



# Building OpenCV from source

##Required build dependencies
We need CMake to configure the installation, GCC for compilation, Python-devel and Numpy for building Python bindings etc.
```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake
sudo apt-get install python-devel numpy
sudo apt-get install gcc gcc-c++
```
Next we need GTK support for GUI features, Camera support (libv4l), Media Support (ffmpeg, gstreamer) etc.
```sh
sudo apt-get install gtk2-devel
sudo apt-get install libv4l-devel
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg-devel
sudo apt-get install gstreamer-plugins-base-devel
```

**Optional Dependencies**

Above dependencies are sufficient to install OpenCV in your Ubuntu machine. But depending upon your requirements, you may need some extra dependencies. A list of such optional dependencies are given below. You can either leave it or install it, your call :)

OpenCV comes with supporting files for image formats like PNG, JPEG, JPEG2000, TIFF, WebP etc. But it may be a little old. If you want to get latest libraries, you can install development files for system libraries of these formats.

```sh
sudo apt-get install libpng-devel
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-turbo-devel
sudo apt-get install jasper-devel
sudo apt-get install openexr-devel
sudo apt-get install libtiff-devel
sudo apt-get install libwebp-devel
```

## Downloading OpenCV

**Reference:**

 - https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/d2/de6/tutorial_py_setup_in_ubuntu.html

To download the latest source from OpenCV's [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/opencv/opencv). (If you want to contribute to OpenCV choose this. For that, you need to install **Git** first)

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
```

It will create a folder "opencv" in current directory. The cloning may take some time depending upon your internet connection.

##Configuring and Installing
Now open a terminal window and navigate to the downloaded "opencv" folder. Create a new "build" folder and navigate to it.

```sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
```
Now you build the files using "make" command and install it using "make install" command.

```sh
$ make
$sudo make install
```

Installation is over. All files are installed in "/usr/local/" folder. Open a terminal and try import "cv2".

```cpp
import cv2 as cv
print(cv.__version__)
```

# Common Questions

- Environment:
  - conda
  - Jupyter

## problom: GTK+
- **Problem Description**

I encounterred this problom and it took me many days to solve it.

![read image example use cv2](images/Anaconda/Error_OpenCV_imshow_gtk2x.png)

*This is the source code*:

```python
import cv2

img = cv2.imread('test.png',0) # 0: gray; 1: color

cv2.imshow('Image',img) # para 1: window name

cv2.waitKey(0)

â€‹**Results**:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
error                                     Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-2-55233ffdf5b9> in <module>
      1 import cv2
      2 img = cv2.imread('test.png',0) # 0: gray; 1: color
----> 3 cv2.imshow('Image',img) # para 1: window name
      4 cv2.waitKey(0)

error: OpenCV(3.4.2) /tmp/build/80754af9/opencv-suite_1535558553474/work/modules/highgui/src/window.cpp:632: error: (-2:Unspecified error) The function is not implemented. Rebuild the library with Windows, GTK+ 2.x or Carbon support. If you are on Ubuntu or Debian, install libgtk2.0-dev and pkg-config, then re-run cmake or configure script in function 'cvShowImage'
```

- **Solutions:**

```sh
conda install -c menpo opencv3
```

## Problem with robots

- ***Problem Description**

![Error due to ROS](images/2018/12/error-due-to-ros.png)

```sh
(TensorflowPy36) yubao@yubao-Z370M-S01:~/GitProject/AI/Source/Tensorflow$ python ImageRead.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ImageRead.py", line 2, in <module>
    import cv2
ImportError: /opt/ros/kinetic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cv2.so: undefined symbol: PyCObject_Type
```

- **Solutions**

```sh
$ vim ~/.bashrc
```
comment this line:
```sh
#source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
```
