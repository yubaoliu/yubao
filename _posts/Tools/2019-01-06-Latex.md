# installation
## Instll on ubuntu
Refer to: [^Manuel Ignacio López Quintero]
1.  INSTALL TEX LIVE
```
sudo apt-get install texlive-full
```
1. INSTALL TEXMAKER

Now you need a text editor. I recommend using a specific editor for LaTeX. There are many text editors for LaTeX on the Internet as Kile, TeXworks, JLatexEditor, Gedit LaTeX Plugin, etc. My favorite text editor for Latex is Texmaker. Texmaker is a cross-platform open source LaTeX editor. To install it, go to the Ubuntu or Debian terminal and enter the following command:
```sh
sudo apt-get install texmaker
```

1. CREATE YOUR FIRST DOCUMENT

To check that everything is working properly, create a LaTeX blank document. Open Texmaker and click on File, New. Then write the following code:
```LaTeX
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
    Hello, world!
\end{document}
```

## How to use Bibliography

1. Create a BibTeX bibliography file (a `bib` file) — see [“creating a BibTeX file”](https://texfaq.org/FAQ-buildbib).

2. Use BibTeX [^latex-tutorial]

   > After creating the bibtex file, we have to tell LaTeX where to find our bibliographic database. For BibTeX this is not much different from printing the table of contents. We just need the commands *\bibliography* which tells LaTeX the location of our .bib file and *\bibliographystyle* which selects one of various bibliographic styles.

3. Compile your bibliography file use *Bibtex* in Tex Maker or command line

   ```bash
   bibtex myfile.tex
   ```

   > Note that, at this stage, LaTeX isn’t “resolving” any of the citations: at every `\cite` command, LaTeX will warn you of the undefined citation, and when the document finishes, there will be a further warning of undefined references.
   >
   > Referrered form: https://texfaq.org/FAQ-usebibtex
   >
   > Most editors will let you select, to run bibtex automatically on compilation.[^latex-tutorial]

4. Compile tex file use pdflatex

5. An example:

   ```latex
   \documentclass{article}
   \bibliographystyle{plain}
   \begin{document}
   Random citation \cite{kalman1960} embeddeed in text.

   \bibliography{biography.bib}
   \end{document}
   ```


## Print single bib entry in article rather than in references

Refer to  https://gking.harvard.edu/files/bibentry2.pdf

## Tips

### Printing single bib entry other than references

**Problem Description**:


The problems is described [^Printing single bib entry in a section other than references]

>Traditionally we use \cite{} to print a list of cited references from a .bib file at the end of document.
>
>Apart from this i need to print one entry in a section (say above reference section).
>
>e.g. I need something like this
>
>Paper published
>
>1. A.dan, i am best, in: journal of.........
>
>References (list of cited references)
>
>1.A.dan, i am best, in: journal of.........

**Solutions**:

I took very long time to find the answer enventually, [^LaTeX: inline BibTeX entries with the bibentry package]

> In the introduction chapter of my PhD dissertation, I had to make a listing of my publications. The obvious brain dead way to achieve this is just typing everything manually in a list. But this feels just so wrong when you're already using BibTeX for managing references and bibliographical stuff. However, the traditional usage of BibTeX in LaTeX is to generate a full list of all references and put this in a dedicated section or chapter.
>
> With the bibentry package (which is part of the [natlib package](http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=natbib) actually) it is possible to put bibliographic entries anywhere in the text. As far as I know and experienced, the bibentry package is included in a default LaTeX setup, so you don't have to install something, just enable it in your document.

```latex
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{bibentry}
\nobibliography*

\begin{document}

\section{Introduction}

Look ma, inline bibtex entries:

\begin{itemize}
\item \bibentry{michael}
\item \bibentry{elvis}
\end{itemize}

\section{And now for something completely different}
Lorem ipsum yada yada,
also see \cite{britney},
yada yada, and \cite{marilyn} too.

\bibliographystyle{alpha}
\bibliography{test_bibentry.bib}

\end{document}
```

> The stuff that's important here: - `\usepackage{bibentry}`: duh. - `\nobibliography*`: tells bibentry to (re)use the bibliographic data from the standard BibTeX setup by `\bibliography{test_bibentry.bib}`. - `\bibentry{foo}`: an inline bibliographic entry will be put here.

### Undefined control sequence when I try to use citet and *citep*

**Problem Description:**

```! Undefined control sequence. \citep```

**Solution**:

```latex
\usepackage{natbib}
```
