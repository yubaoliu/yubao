#  Install

Download the disk image from the CMake [website](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html). Pick the correct download for whichever version of OS X you are using. Use the installer and follow its directions. It will ask if you want it to make the command line tools available in your path by creating symbolic links, have it do so.

This provides the `cmake` command, the CMake GUI (`CMake.app`), and the curses interface (`ccmake`).

## Homebrew

If you already have homebrew installed you can simply install CMake with the command brew install cmake.

This provides the `cmake` command and the curses interface (`ccmake`) but **not** the CMake GUI.

# Linux
## Ubuntu (Debian)

The simplest way to install CMake is via the command line:

​	``sudo apt-get install cmake cmake-qt-gui``

 If your Ubuntu install doesn’t include X or you primarily use ssh sessions you will also want to install the `cmake-curses-gui` package. Again this is simplest with the command

​	 ``sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui``,

but either GUI interface can be used instead.

This provides the `cmake` command and the CMake GUI (`cmake-gui`). The second, optional, package provides the curses interface (`ccmake`).

**ccmake ncurses**

```
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui
ccmake ..
```
