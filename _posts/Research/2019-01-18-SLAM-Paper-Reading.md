## Abstract

我们提出了一个在线对象级SLAM系统,持久且准确的构建任意重建对象的3D图形图(graph map)。
当RGB-D相机浏览时一个杂乱的室内场景，Mask-RCNN instance segmentations 被用于初始化紧凑的每对象具有对象尺寸相关分辨率和新颖的3D前景蒙版的Truncated
Signed Distance Function（TSDF）重建。重建的对象存储在可优化的中
6DoF位姿图，它是我们唯一的持久地图表示。物体通过深度融合逐步细化（refined），并用于跟踪，重定位和閉環检测。閉環导致对象实例的相对姿势估计的调整，但没有内部对象（intra-object）的變形。每个对象还携带语义信息,並隨着時間的推移不断更新（refined），和一个存在概率来解释虚假的实例的预测. 我们在手持RGB-D上展示了我们的方法从一个包含大量
和各种对象实例杂乱的办公室场景中，突出显示系统如何实现闭环并在重复的循环中充分利用现有对象。
我们定量地评估我们的系统相对于RGB-D SLAM基准的基线方法的轨迹误差，并定性地比较YCB视频数据集上发现的对象的重建质量。性能评估显示我们的方法具有高内存效率，并且在4-8Hz（不包括重定位）的情况下在线运行，尽管没有在软件级别进行优化。

We propose an online **object-level** SLAM system which
builds a persistent and accurate 3D graph map of arbi-
trary reconstructed objects. As an RGB-D camera browses
a cluttered indoor scene, Mask-RCNN instance segmenta-
tions are used to initialise compact per-object Truncated
Signed Distance Function (TSDF) reconstructions with ob-
ject size-dependent resolutions and a novel 3D foreground
mask. Reconstructed objects are stored in an optimisable
6DoF pose graph which is our only persistent map repre-
sentation. Objects are incrementally refined via depth fu-
sion, and are used for tracking, relocalisation and loop clo-
sure detection. Loop closures cause adjustments in the rel-
ative pose estimates of object instances, but no intra-object
warping. Each object also carries semantic information
which is refined over time and an existence probability to
account for spurious instance predictions.


We demonstrate our approach on a hand-held RGB-D
sequence from a cluttered office scene with a large number
and variety of object instances, highlighting how the sys-
tem closes loops and makes good use of existing objects on
repeated loops.

We quantitatively evaluate the trajectory er-
ror of our system against a baseline approach on the RGB-
D SLAM benchmark, and qualitatively compare reconstruc-
tion quality of discovered objects on the YCB video dataset.
Performance evaluation shows our approach is highly mem-
ory efficient and runs online at 4-8Hz (excluding relocalisa-
tion) despite not being optimised at the software level.

## Introduction

Indoor scene understanding and 3D mapping is a foundational technology that can enable autonomous real-world
robotic task completion and also provide a common interface for more intelligent and intuitive **human-map and
human-robot interactions**. To enable this requires a careful
choice of map representation. One particularly useful repre-
sentation is to build an **object-oriented map**. We argue this
is a natural and efficient way to represent the things that are
most important for robotic scene understanding, planning
and interaction; and it is also highly suitable as the basis for
human-robot communication.


**Limitations**:

This approach also naturally paves the way towards interaction and dynamic object reasoning, although our system currently assumes a static environment and does not yet aim to track individual dynamic objects.
